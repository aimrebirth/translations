The level of a modifier shows how big the enhancement was, how much a given parameter changed. The most common ones feature five levels of modification. <br>Modifier is used by bringing it into the device to be upgraded. This serves as a command for the hangar systems, which automatically start working. The information is deleted after being read from the modifier, and the empty modifier is returned to the base.

   "TEXT": "<image:MOD_ICO_03_TOLERANCE>The founder of the clan: MORRANDO, fifth-generation Mechmind. <br>The leader of the Tolerances' clan is considered to be a peaceful and calm Mechmind, an attitude which also characterizes the clan as a whole. They are powerful, but generally seek only to trade, bringing up their influence gradually and without as much aggression as many of the other clans. MORRANDO considers economic development to be the most effective; however, this clan has its share of effective fighters who are able to protect the clan's interests."

If you want enemies to lose a building, you need to stop its production by buying all resources from the warehouse or by destroying as many enemies as possible, and convincing them right away.

It unified the minds of all Mechminds -- every one of us -- into one multi-dimensional structure. It sounds impossible, but it allowed everyone to see the world through the sensors of another, allowing everyone to know the individual Goals of every other one. And Super was in this structure. He was something abstract, misleading, and disharmonizing. Actually, he was the harmony himself, but it was different from the Mechminds. We cannot explain it to you, because you never took part in the Reformation.<p>Anyway, it changed the Mechminds. The unity of the structure did not last long. It broke down into many elements, with each having its own color, force, and structure. Later on, we realized that each element represented a newly created clan. A clan is no longer just a group of Mechminds united by a mutual concept of perfection. It is now an element of the original multidimensional structure. It is initially simpler and weaker than what clans once were, but it can develop and become more complicated, if it generates force through numbers. However, it can fade or even completely vanish if a clan should weaken. We are sure that Super gave the Mechminds a new stimulus for individual development.
