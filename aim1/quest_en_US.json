But after this story in the Arctic Sector they got their new name which suits them perfectly. This was also when everyone understood that the symbiots like non-standard decisions. Several Wild Ones attacked a group of Trances. The  usual matter - give us your cargo and then you will be set free. The Trances agreed, discharged all their cargo, and started moving back. The Wild Ones picked everything up, chased the Trances down and killed them all. Nobody  does that, but that's why they are the Wild Ones. In fact, they are not very  strong when they are alone, but they usually move in groups of several attack gliders and are a serious menace. At the moment the whole clan is at war with the Destroyers, and everyone is better off that way. I couldn't tell you about the goal of the Wild Ones. Sometimes it seems to me that they don't  have one. They roam about the world and fight anyone who is in their way. Sooner or later they will run into the Sinigers and will be completely eliminated. But this time is yet to come."
